# What to know
### The Interviewer Is Your Best Resource
The person interviewing you wants you to be the best candidate they've ever interviewed. They are probably a programmer or manager of programmers and interviewing people is not their main job and consequently not the thing they want to be focusing on at work. The fewer people they have to interview the better. They will answer any questions you have to improve your performance. If you THINK OUT LOUD, they will probably offer up suggestions. They will offer hints if you seem to be getting stuck because, again, they want you to do well.

### Big O
Get very good at Big O, both time and space complexity. Know where you can
optimize for time, where you can optimize for space, and why you might want to
do one or the other
- It will almost certainly come up in your interview and can be make or
break
- Your code will be better
- First find A solution, then find a solution optimized for Big O (either
time or space), then offer an alternative that optimizes for the other 
    
### Data Structures
- Hash Tables ***
- linked lists
- stacks & queues
- trees, tries & graphs
- Heaps
- Vectors/ArrayLists

### Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Concepts
- Big O Time & Space
- Recursion
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Bit Manipulation
- Dynamic Programming
    
# How to Work Through a Problem
[Cheat
Sheet](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf)

1. Listen/Read carefully
    - Don't have the right answer to the wrong question
    - Watch for any particularly interesting nuggets of information. They will
    likely be useful for finding an optimal solution
    - If you are unsure of anything ASK
2. Put an example on the board
    - You don't have to work everything out in your head. Paper was invented a
    few thousand years ago because writing stuff down makes thinking and
    remembering easier
    - THINK OUT LOUD
3. Get a Brute Force Solution
    - Get an obvious, terrible solution first. The interviewer doesn't know that
    you know the easy (and bad) way to solve a thing    
    - It's much easier to improve a bad solution than to jump straight to a
    perfect one. This is the first step on your ladder to optimal code
    - THINK OUT LOUD
4. Optimize!
    - See if you can make use of unused information
    - Optimize for time, then see if you can optimize for space (Big O) and talk
    about why you might want one or the other
    - You can probably use a hash table
    - think BUD
    ```
    Bottlenecks
    Unnecessary Work
    Duplicated Work
    ```
    - THINK OUT LOUD
    
5. Walk Through
    - This is the step where you start doing anything that approaches code
    - Pseudocode basic steps ex. "1) search array 2) find biggest number" etc.
    - Make these plain english steps, NO CODE. These can then be translated into
    code
    - THINK OUT LOUD
6. Implement
    - Start writing your code in the top far left of the whiteboard
    - Be careful not to slant your lines
    - Pretend helper functions exist to do smaller steps and fill those in later
    if necessary. For example, assume you have a `sum()` to add numbers rather
    than implementing it, then implement it if they ask you to.
    - Use semantic variable names
    - THINK OUT LOUD
7. Test
    - Do a 'conceptual' test, readnig through each line of code (OUT LOUD) to
    make sure it does what you think it does
    - Double check anything that looks weird
    - Double check anything that generally causes you trouble (recursion etc)
    - Do small test cases
    - Take edge cases into account
    - THINK OUT LOUD

# How to Practice
    - Practice every day
    - Write code on paper
    - Follow the same steps you would as if you were whiteboarding in an interview
    - If the company uses a specific language, practice in that language    
    - THINK OUT LOUD
